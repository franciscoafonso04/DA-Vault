# DA-Hub

Welcome to the **DA-Vault**, a repository containing my projects for the **Algorithm Design (Desenho de Algoritmos)** course. Here, you'll find various algorithmic techniques of wide applicability, such as brute-force, backtracking, divide-and-conquer, greedy and dynamic programming, ubiquitous in real-life algorithmic implementation solutions.

## Projects

### **Project 1: [An Analysis Tool for Water Supply Management]** (Grade: 15.8)
   - **Description**: Implement an analysis tool that can support
the Management Team of a water supply network in Portugal to make informed decisions about how to
best allocate its resources, both financial as well as physical.

   - **Developed by**:

### **Project 2: [Routing Algorithm for Ocean Shipping and Urban Deliveries]** (Grade: 18.35)
   - **Description**: Implement a basic exhaustive approach for the classic routing
problem using the TSP abstraction, learning that although such an approach can find
optimal solutions, its applicability is restricted to tiny graphs. Refine your critical thinking
skills, by developing and analyzing a set of approximate solutions to the TSP.
